/**
 * The Rules that define template constraints in an AWS Service Catalog portfolio describe when end
 * users can use the template and which values they can specify for parameters that are declared in the
 * AWS CloudFormation template used to create the product they are attempting to use.
 *
 * Rules
 * are useful for preventing end users from inadvertently specifying an incorrect value.
 * For example, you can add a rule to verify whether end users specified a valid subnet in a
 * given VPC or used m1.small instance types for test environments. AWS CloudFormation uses
 * rules to validate parameter values before it creates the resources for the product.
 *
 * A rule can include a RuleCondition property and must include an Assertions property.
 * For each rule, you can define only one rule condition; you can define one or more asserts within
 * the Assertions property.
 * You define a rule condition and assertions by using rule-specific intrinsic functions.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * CfnInclude cfnTemplate;
 * // mutating the rule
 * CfnParameter myParameter;
 * CfnRule rule = cfnTemplate.getRule("MyRule");
 * rule.addAssertion(Fn.conditionContains(List.of("m1.small"), myParameter.getValueAsString()),
 * "MyParameter has to be m1.small");
 * ```
