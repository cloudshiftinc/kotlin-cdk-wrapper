/**
 * Use the CDK classic way of referencing assets.
 *
 * This synthesizer will generate CloudFormation parameters for every referenced
 * asset, and use the CLI's current credentials to deploy the stack.
 *
 * * It does not support cross-account deployment (the CLI must have credentials
 * to the account you are trying to deploy to).
 * * It cannot be used with **CDK Pipelines**. To deploy using CDK Pipelines,
 * you must use the `DefaultStackSynthesizer`.
 * * Each asset will take up a CloudFormation Parameter in your template. Keep in
 * mind that there is a maximum of 200 parameters in a CloudFormation template.
 * To use deterministic asset locations instead, use `CliCredentialsStackSynthesizer`.
 *
 * Be aware that your CLI credentials must be valid for the duration of the
 * entire deployment. If you are using session credentials, make sure the
 * session lifetime is long enough.
 *
 * This is the only StackSynthesizer that supports customizing asset behavior
 * by overriding `Stack.addFileAsset()` and `Stack.addDockerImageAsset()`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.*;
 * LegacyStackSynthesizer legacyStackSynthesizer = new LegacyStackSynthesizer();
 * ```
