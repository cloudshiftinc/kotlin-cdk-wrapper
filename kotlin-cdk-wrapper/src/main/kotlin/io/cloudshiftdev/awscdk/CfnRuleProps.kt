/**
 * A rule can include a RuleCondition property and must include an Assertions property.
 *
 * For each rule, you can define only one rule condition; you can define one or more asserts within
 * the Assertions property.
 * You define a rule condition and assertions by using rule-specific intrinsic functions.
 *
 * You can use the following rule-specific intrinsic functions to define rule conditions and
 * assertions:
 *
 * Fn::And
 * Fn::Contains
 * Fn::EachMemberEquals
 * Fn::EachMemberIn
 * Fn::Equals
 * Fn::If
 * Fn::Not
 * Fn::Or
 * Fn::RefAll
 * Fn::ValueOf
 * Fn::ValueOfAll
 *
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/reference-template_constraint_rules.html
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.*;
 * ICfnConditionExpression cfnConditionExpression;
 * CfnRuleProps cfnRuleProps = CfnRuleProps.builder()
 * .assertions(List.of(CfnRuleAssertion.builder()
 * .assert(cfnConditionExpression)
 * .assertDescription("assertDescription")
 * .build()))
 * .ruleCondition(cfnConditionExpression)
 * .build();
 * ```
