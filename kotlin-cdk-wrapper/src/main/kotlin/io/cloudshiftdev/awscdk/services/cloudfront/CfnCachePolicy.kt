/**
 * A cache policy.
 *
 * When it's attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the following:
 *
 * * The values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These values can include HTTP headers,
 * cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it
 * can return to the viewer.
 * * The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in
 * the CloudFront cache.
 *
 * The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are also included in
 * requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid
 * object in its cache that matches the request's cache key. If you want to send values to the origin
 * but *not* include them in the cache key, use `OriginRequestPolicy` .
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.cloudfront.*;
 * CfnCachePolicy cfnCachePolicy = CfnCachePolicy.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnCachePolicy")
