/**
 * The `AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard` resource specifies an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard.
 *
 * A dashboard is a customizable home page in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor
 * your AWS resources in a single view.
 *
 * All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.cloudwatch.*;
 * CfnDashboard cfnDashboard = CfnDashboard.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnDashboard")
 * .dashboardBody("dashboardBody")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .dashboardName("dashboardName")
 * .build();
 * ```
