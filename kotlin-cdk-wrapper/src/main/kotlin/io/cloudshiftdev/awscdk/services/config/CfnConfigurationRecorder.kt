/**
 * The `AWS::Config::ConfigurationRecorder` resource type describes the AWS resource types that AWS
 * Config records for configuration changes.
 *
 * The configuration recorder stores the configuration changes of the specified resources in your
 * account as configuration items.
 *
 *
 * To enable AWS Config , you must create a configuration recorder and a delivery channel.
 *
 * AWS Config uses the delivery channel to deliver the configuration changes to your Amazon S3
 * bucket or Amazon SNS topic. For more information, see
 * [AWS::Config::DeliveryChannel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-config-deliverychannel.html)
 * .
 *
 *
 * AWS CloudFormation starts the recorder as soon as the delivery channel is available.
 *
 * To stop the recorder and delete it, delete the configuration recorder from your stack. To stop
 * the recorder without deleting it, call the
 * [StopConfigurationRecorder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_StopConfigurationRecorder.html)
 * action of the AWS Config API directly.
 *
 * For more information, see [Configuration
 * Recorder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/config-concepts.html#config-recorder)
 * in the AWS Config Developer Guide.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.config.*;
 * CfnConfigurationRecorder cfnConfigurationRecorder = CfnConfigurationRecorder.Builder.create(this,
 * "MyCfnConfigurationRecorder")
 * .roleArn("roleArn")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .name("name")
 * .recordingGroup(RecordingGroupProperty.builder()

 * .exclusionByResourceTypes(ExclusionByResourceTypesProperty.builder()

       *
       * Unless specifically listed as exclusions, `AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster` will be recorded
       * automatically in all supported AWS Config Regions were the configuration recorder is enabled.
       *
       * IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies will be recorded in the Region

       * If you choose `EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES` for the recording strategy, the
       * `ExclusionByResourceTypes` field will override other properties in the request.
       *
       * For example, even if you set `IncludeGlobalResourceTypes` to false, global IAM resource
       * types will still be automatically recorded in this option unless those resource types are

       * Config adds support for a new resource type in the Region where you set up the configuration
       * recorder, including global resource types, AWS Config starts recording resources of that type
       * automatically.
       *
       * Unless specifically listed as exclusions, `AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster` will be recorded
       * automatically in all supported AWS Config Regions were the configuration recorder is enabled.
       *
       * IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies will be recorded in the Region

       * before February 2022. You cannot be record the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported
