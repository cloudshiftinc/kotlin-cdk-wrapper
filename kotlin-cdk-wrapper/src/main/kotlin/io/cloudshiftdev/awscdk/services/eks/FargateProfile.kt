/**
 * Fargate profiles allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate.
 *
 * This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each
 * profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and optional
 * labels. You must define a namespace for every selector. The label field
 * consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match a selector (by
 * matching a namespace for the selector and all of the labels specified in the
 * selector) are scheduled on Fargate. If a namespace selector is defined
 * without any labels, Amazon EKS will attempt to schedule all pods that run in
 * that namespace onto Fargate using the profile. If a to-be-scheduled pod
 * matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is
 * scheduled on Fargate.
 *
 * If a pod matches multiple Fargate profiles, Amazon EKS picks one of the
 * matches at random. In this case, you can specify which profile a pod should
 * use by adding the following Kubernetes label to the pod specification:
 * eks.amazonaws.com/fargate-profile: profile_name. However, the pod must still
 * match a selector in that profile in order to be scheduled onto Fargate.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * Cluster cluster;
 * FargateProfile.Builder.create(this, "MyProfile")
 * .cluster(cluster)
 * .selectors(List.of(Selector.builder().namespace("default").build()))
 * .build();
 * ```
