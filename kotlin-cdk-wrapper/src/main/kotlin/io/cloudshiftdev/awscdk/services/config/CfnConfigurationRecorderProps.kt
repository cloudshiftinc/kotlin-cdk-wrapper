     * AWS Config supports *Continuous recording* and *Daily recording* .
     *
     * * Continuous recording allows you to record configuration changes continuously whenever a
     * change occurs.
     * * Daily recording allows you to receive a configuration item (CI) representing the most
     * recent state of your resources over the last 24-hour period, only if itâ€™s different from the
     * previous CI recorded.
     *
     *
     * AWS Firewall Manager depends on continuous recording to monitor your resources. If you are
     * using Firewall Manager, it is recommended that you set the recording frequency to Continuous.
     *
     *
     * You can also override the recording frequency for specific resource types.

     * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role assumed by AWS Config and used by the

     * For more information, see [Permissions for the IAM Role
     * Assigned](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iamrole-permissions.html) to
     * AWS Config in the AWS Config Developer Guide.
     *
     *
     * *Pre-existing AWS Config role*
     *
     * If you have used an AWS service that uses AWS Config , such as AWS Security Hub or AWS
     * Control Tower , and an AWS Config role has already been created, make sure that the IAM role
     * that you use when setting up AWS Config keeps the same minimum permissions as the already
     * created AWS Config role. You must do this so that the other AWS service continues to run as
     * expected.
     *
     * For example, if AWS Control Tower has an IAM role that allows AWS Config to read Amazon
     * Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) objects, make sure that the same permissions are granted
     * within the IAM role you use when setting up AWS Config . Otherwise, it may interfere with how
     * AWS Control Tower operates. For more information about IAM roles for AWS Config , see [*Identity
     * and Access Management for AWS
     * Config*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html) in the *AWS
     * Config Developer Guide* .
