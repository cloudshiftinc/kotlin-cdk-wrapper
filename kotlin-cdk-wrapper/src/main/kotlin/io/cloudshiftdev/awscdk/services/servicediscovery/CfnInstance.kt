     * * For each attribute, the applicable value.
     *
     * Supported attribute keys include the following:
     *
     * * **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME** - If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record that
     * routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is
     * associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see

     * in the *Route 53 API Reference* .
     *
     * Note the following:
     *
     * * The configuration for the service that is specified by `ServiceId` must include settings
     * for an `A` record, an `AAAA` record, or both.
     * * In the service that is specified by `ServiceId` , the value of `RoutingPolicy` must be
     * `WEIGHTED` .
     * * If the service that is specified by `ServiceId` includes `HealthCheckConfig` settings, AWS
     * Cloud Map will create the health check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias
     * record.
     * * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS
     * resources other than ELB load balancers.
     * * If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` , don't specify values for any of the
     * `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.
     * * **AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID** - *HTTP namespaces only.* The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the
     * instance. The `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address. When
     * creating resources with a type of

     * `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address.
     * * **AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS** - If the service configuration includes
     * `HealthCheckCustomConfig` , when creating resources with a type of
     * [AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-servicediscovery-instance.html)

     * `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` , the initial status is `HEALTHY` . This attribute can only be used
     * when creating resources and will not be seen on existing resources.
     * * **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME** - If the service configuration includes a `CNAME` record, the domain
     * name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, `example.com` .
     *
     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an
     * `CNAME` record.
     *
     * * **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4** - If the service configuration includes an `A` record, the IPv4
     * address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, `192.0.2.44` .
     *
     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an `A`
     * record. If the service includes settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for
     * `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` , `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6` , or both.
     *
     * * **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6** - If the service configuration includes an `AAAA` record, the IPv6
     * address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example,
     * `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345` .

     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an
