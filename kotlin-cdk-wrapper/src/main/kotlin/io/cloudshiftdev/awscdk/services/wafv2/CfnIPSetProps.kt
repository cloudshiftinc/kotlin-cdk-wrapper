     * `us-east-1` .

     * The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category

     * as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
     *
     *
     * To modify tags on existing resources, use the AWS WAF APIs or command line interface. With
     * AWS CloudFormation , you can only add tags to AWS WAF resources during resource creation.
