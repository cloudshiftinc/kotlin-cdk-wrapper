/**
 * The `AWS::GameLift::MatchmakingConfiguration` resource defines a new matchmaking configuration
 * for use with FlexMatch.
 *
 * Whether you're using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the
 * matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're using
 * GameLift hosting, it also defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system
 * can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests
 * identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes that are consistent with
 * that configuration.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.gamelift.*;
 * CfnMatchmakingConfiguration cfnMatchmakingConfiguration =

   * This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session.
   *
   * For example, you might use a `GameProperty` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty,
   * or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: `{"Key": "difficulty",
   * "Value":"Novice"}` .
   *
   * You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties
   * of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys
   * and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.
   *
   * For examples of working with game properties, see [Create a game session with
   * properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties)
   * .
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```
   * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
   * // The values are placeholders you should change.
   * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.gamelift.*;
   * GamePropertyProperty gamePropertyProperty = GamePropertyProperty.builder()
