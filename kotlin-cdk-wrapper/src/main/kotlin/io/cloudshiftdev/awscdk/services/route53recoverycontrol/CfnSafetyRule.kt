/**
 * Creates a safety rule in a control panel in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
 *
 * Safety rules in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller let you add safeguards around
 * changing routing control states, and enabling and disabling routing controls, to help prevent
 * unwanted outcomes. Note that the name of a safety rule must be unique within a control panel.
 *
 * There are two types of safety rules in Route 53 ARC: assertion rules and gating rules.
 *
 * Assertion rule: An assertion rule enforces that, when you change a routing control state, certain
 * criteria are met. For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is `On`
 * after the transaction completes so that traffic continues to be directed to at least one cell for
 * the application. This prevents a fail-open scenario.
 *
 * Gating rule: A gating rule lets you configure a gating routing control as an overall on-off
 * switch for a group of routing controls. Or, you can configure more complex gating scenarios, for
 * example, by configuring multiple gating routing controls.
 *
 * For more information, see [Safety
 * rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.safety-rules.html) in the
 * Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.route53recoverycontrol.*;
 * CfnSafetyRule cfnSafetyRule = CfnSafetyRule.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnSafetyRule")
 * .controlPanelArn("controlPanelArn")
 * .name("name")
 * .ruleConfig(RuleConfigProperty.builder()
 * .inverted(false)
 * .threshold(123)
 * .type("type")
 * .build())
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .assertionRule(AssertionRuleProperty.builder()
 * .assertedControls(List.of("assertedControls"))
 * .waitPeriodMs(123)
 * .build())
 * .gatingRule(GatingRuleProperty.builder()
 * .gatingControls(List.of("gatingControls"))
 * .targetControls(List.of("targetControls"))
 * .waitPeriodMs(123)
 * .build())
 * .tags(List.of(CfnTag.builder()
 * .key("key")
 * .value("value")
 * .build()))
 * .build();
