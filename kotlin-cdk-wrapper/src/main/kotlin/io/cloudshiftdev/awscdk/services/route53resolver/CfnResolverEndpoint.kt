/**
 * Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:.
 *
 * * An *inbound Resolver endpoint* forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your
 * network.
 * * An *outbound Resolver endpoint* forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your
 * network.
 *
 *
 * * You cannot update `ResolverEndpointType` and `IpAddresses` in the same request.
 * * When you update a dual-stack IP address, you must update both IP addresses. You canâ€™t update
 * only an IPv4 or IPv6 and keep an existing IP address.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.route53resolver.*;
 * CfnResolverEndpoint cfnResolverEndpoint = CfnResolverEndpoint.Builder.create(this,
 * "MyCfnResolverEndpoint")
 * .direction("direction")
 * .ipAddresses(List.of(IpAddressRequestProperty.builder()
 * .subnetId("subnetId")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .ip("ip")
 * .ipv6("ipv6")
 * .build()))
 * .securityGroupIds(List.of("securityGroupIds"))
