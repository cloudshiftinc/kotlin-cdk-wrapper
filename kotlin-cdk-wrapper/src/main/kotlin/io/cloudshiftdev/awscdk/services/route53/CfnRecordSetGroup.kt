     * :
     * * For regional APIs, specify the value of `regionalDomainName` .

     * of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as `da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net` .
     *
     *
     * The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
     * such as `api.example.com` .

     * * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint** - Enter the API endpoint for the
     * interface endpoint, such as
     * `vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com` .
     * For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront distribution.
     * You can get the value of `DnsName` using the AWS CLI command
     * [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html)
     * .
     * * **CloudFront distribution** - Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you
     * created your distribution.
     *
     * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
     * the record. For example, if the name of the record is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront
     * distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of the alternate domain names. For more
     * information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names
     * (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the
     * *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
     *
     * You can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront
     * distribution.
     *
     *
     * For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary
     * and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
     * name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't
     * include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.
     *
     *
     * * **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk
     * environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias
     * record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment.
     * *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
     *
     *
     * For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
     * region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
     * alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example,
     * if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
     * acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
     * routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
     *
     *
     * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME`
     * attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
     * attribute:
     *
     * * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console,
     * see [Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic
     * Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html) in the
     * *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .
     * * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the `DescribeEnvironments` action to get the value of the
     * `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see
     * [DescribeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html)
     * in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

     * in the *AWS CLI* .
     * * **ELB load balancer** - Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get
     * the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console , the ELB API, or the AWS CLI .
     * * *AWS Management Console* : Go to the EC2 page, choose *Load Balancers* in the navigation
     * pane, choose the load balancer, choose the *Description* tab, and get the value of the *DNS
     * name* field.
     *
     * If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with
     * *dualstack* . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that
     * applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

     * * **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the

     * 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
     *
     * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
     *
     * * **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
     * * *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` ,
     * Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
     * registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2
     * instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
     * resources.
     * * *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
     * Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load
     * balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
     * * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
     * that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
     * only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries
     * to other resources.
     * * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
     *
     *
     * When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
     * checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create
     * Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
     *
     *
     * * **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to
     * `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
     * * **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in
     * `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is

       * routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
       *
       *
       * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME`

       * * **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the

       * * **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an
       * Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer,
       * Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
       * registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer
       * if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true`
       * and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route
       * 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
       *
       * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
       * requirements.
       *
       * * **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
       * * *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` ,
       * Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
       * registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no
       * EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
       * other resources.
       * * *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
       * Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the
       * load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
       * balancer:
       * * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
       * that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
       * only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries
       * to other resources.
       * * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
       *
       *
       * When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
       * checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create
       * Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
       *
       *
       * * **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to
       * `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
       * * **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in
       * `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is
       * not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the
       * records in the alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit Health
       * Checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting)

    /**
     * *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
     * Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query.
     *
     * For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP
     * address of `192.0.2.111` , create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and a
     * `ContinentCode` of `AF` .
     *
     * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example,
     * one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
     * goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to
     * one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.
     *
     * You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
     * location.
     *
     * The value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
     * specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and
     * `Type` elements.
     *
     *
     * Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
     * mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
     * cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't
     * identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
     * `CountryCode` is `*` . Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this
     * record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource
     * record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create
     * a `*` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those
     * locations.
     *
     *
     * You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
     * `Name` and `Type` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

     * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:
     *
     * * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)
     * * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

     * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record
     * among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
     * to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
     * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     *
     * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record
     * set in the same hosted zone.
     * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
     * healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
     * alias resource record set.
     *
     *
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
     * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate
     * health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record
     * sets.
     *
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
     * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have
     * resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North
     * America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all
     * locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for
     * healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for
     * which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * * The United States
     * * North America
     * * The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create
     * a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP`
     * server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
     * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     *
     * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     *
     * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of
     * a resource record set.
     * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

       * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:

       * * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health
       * checks)
       * * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)
       *
       *
       * Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
       * set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the `Value` element. When you
       * add a `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the

       *
       *
       * For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :
       *
       * * [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
       * Healthy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html)
       * * [Route 53 Health Checks and DNS
       * Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)
       * * [Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted
       * Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html)
       *
       * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
       *
       * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
       * or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
       * choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
       * the following configurations:
       *
       * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
       * all the resource record sets.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the
       * record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
       * responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
       * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries
       * accordingly.
       *
       * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
       * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
       * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
       * record set in the same hosted zone.
       * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
       * be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
       * with.
       *
       * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
       * alias resource record set.
       *
       *
       * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
       * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
       * associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
       * resource record sets.
       *
       *
       * *Geolocation Routing*
       *
       * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
       * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
       * have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
       * North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies
       * to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
       * checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
       * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
       *
       * * The United States
       * * North America
       * * The default resource record set
       *
       * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
       *
       * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
       * create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
       * `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
       * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
       *
       *
       * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
       *
       * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name
       * of a resource record set.
       * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

       *
       * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
       *
       * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
       * or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
       * choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
       * the following configurations:
       *
       * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
       * all the resource record sets.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the
       * record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
       * responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
       * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries
       * accordingly.
       *
       * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
       * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
       * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
       * record set in the same hosted zone.
       * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
       * be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
       * with.
       *
       * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
       * alias resource record set.
       *
       *
       * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
       * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
       * associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
       * resource record sets.
       *
       *
       * *Geolocation Routing*
       *
       * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
       * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
       * have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
       * North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies
       * to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
       * checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
       * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
       *
       * * The United States
       * * North America
       * * The default resource record set
       *
       * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
       *
       * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
       * create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
       * `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
       * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
       *
       *
       * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
       *
       * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name
       * of a resource record set.
       * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

       * *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
       * Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query.
       *
       * For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP
       * address of `192.0.2.111` , create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and a
       * `ContinentCode` of `AF` .
       *
       * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for
       * example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent),
       * priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a
       * continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different
       * resource.
       *
       * You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
       * location.
       *
       * The value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
       * specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name`
       * and `Type` elements.
       *
       *
       * Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
       * mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
       * cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
       * can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
       * `CountryCode` is `*` . Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in
       * this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation
       * resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you
       * don't create a `*` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries
       * from those locations.
       *
       *
       * You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
       * `Name` and `Type` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

       * only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the `HealthCheckId` element and
       * specify the ID of the applicable health check.
       *
       * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:
       *
       * * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
       * * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health
       * checks)
       * * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)
       *
       *
       * Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
       * set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the `Value` element. When you
       * add a `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the
       * endpoint that you specified in the health check.
       *
       *
       * For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

       *
       * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
       *
       * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
       * or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
       * choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
       * the following configurations:
       *
       * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
       * all the resource record sets.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the
       * record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
       *
       * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
       * responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
       * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries
       * accordingly.
       *
       * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
       * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
       * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
       * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
       * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
       * record set in the same hosted zone.
       * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
       *
       * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
       * be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
       * with.
       *
       * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
       * alias resource record set.
       *
       *
       * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
       * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
       * associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
       * resource record sets.
       *
       *
       * *Geolocation Routing*
       *
       * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
       * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
       * have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
       * North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies
       * to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
       * checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
       * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
       *
       * * The United States
       * * North America
       * * The default resource record set
       *
       * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
       *
       * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
       * create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
       * `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
       * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
       *
       *
       * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
       *
       * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name
       * of a resource record set.
       * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

       * * *CloudFront distributions:* `A`

       * If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two resource record sets to route traffic

       * * *Amazon S3 buckets:* `A`
       * * *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints* `A`
       * * *Another resource record set in this hosted zone:* Specify the type of the resource
       * record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except `NS` and `SOA`

       *
       * If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
       * zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of `Type` is `CNAME` .
       * This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're routing traffic
       * to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

       * *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
       * combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that
       * Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set.
       *
       * Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same
       * combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a
       * resource's weight to the total. Note the following:
       *
       * * You must specify a value for the `Weight` element for every weighted resource record set.
       * * You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per weighted resource record set.
       * * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the
       * same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as weighted resource record sets.
       * * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values
       * for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
       * * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set `Weight` to `0`
       * for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for
       * that resource record set. However, if you set `Weight` to `0` for all resource record sets
       * that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with
       * equal probability.
       *
       * The effect of setting `Weight` to `0` is different when you associate health checks with
       * weighted resource record sets. For more information, see [Options for Configuring Route 53
       * Active-Active and Active-Passive
