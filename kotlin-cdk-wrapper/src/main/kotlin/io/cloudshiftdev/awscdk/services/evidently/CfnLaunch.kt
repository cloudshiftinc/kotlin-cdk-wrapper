/**
 * Creates or updates a *launch* of a given feature.
 *
 * Before you create a launch, you must create the feature to use for the launch.
 *
 * You can use a launch to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of
 * your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to
 * help you decide when to ramp up traffic to more users. This helps you reduce risk and identify
 * unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.evidently.*;
 * CfnLaunch cfnLaunch = CfnLaunch.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnLaunch")
