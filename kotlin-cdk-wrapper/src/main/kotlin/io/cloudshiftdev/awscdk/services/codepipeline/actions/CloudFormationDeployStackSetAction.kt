/**
 * CodePipeline action to deploy a stackset.
 *
 * CodePipeline offers the ability to perform AWS CloudFormation StackSets
 * operations as part of your CI/CD process. You use a stack set to create
 * stacks in AWS accounts across AWS Regions by using a single AWS
 * CloudFormation template. All the resources included in each stack are defined
 * by the stack set’s AWS CloudFormation template. When you create the stack
 * set, you specify the template to use, as well as any parameters and
 * capabilities that the template requires.
 *
 * For more information about concepts for AWS CloudFormation StackSets, see
 * <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html">StackSets
 * concepts</a>
 * in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
 *
 * If you use this action to make an update that includes adding stack
 * instances, the new instances are deployed first and the update is completed
 * last. The new instances first receive the old version, and then the update is
 * applied to all instances.
 *
 * As a best practice, you should construct your pipeline so that the stack set
 * is created and initially deploys to a subset or a single instance. After you
 * test your deployment and view the generated stack set, then add the
 * CloudFormationStackInstances action so that the remaining instances are
 * created and updated.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * Pipeline pipeline;
 * Artifact sourceOutput;
 * pipeline.addStage(StageOptions.builder()
 * .stageName("DeployStackSets")
 * .actions(List.of(
 * // First, update the StackSet itself with the newest template
 * CloudFormationDeployStackSetAction.Builder.create()
 * .actionName("UpdateStackSet")
 * .runOrder(1)
 * .stackSetName("MyStackSet")
 * .template(StackSetTemplate.fromArtifactPath(sourceOutput.atPath("template.yaml")))
 * // Change this to 'StackSetDeploymentModel.organizations()' if you want to deploy to OUs
 * .deploymentModel(StackSetDeploymentModel.selfManaged())
 * // This deploys to a set of accounts
 * .stackInstances(StackInstances.inAccounts(List.of("111111111111"), List.of("us-east-1",
 * "eu-west-1")))
 * .build(),
 * // Afterwards, update/create additional instances in other accounts
 * CloudFormationDeployStackInstancesAction.Builder.create()
 * .actionName("AddMoreInstances")
 * .runOrder(2)
 * .stackSetName("MyStackSet")
 * .stackInstances(StackInstances.inAccounts(List.of("222222222222", "333333333333"),
 * List.of("us-east-1", "eu-west-1")))
 * .build()))
 * .build());
 * ```
