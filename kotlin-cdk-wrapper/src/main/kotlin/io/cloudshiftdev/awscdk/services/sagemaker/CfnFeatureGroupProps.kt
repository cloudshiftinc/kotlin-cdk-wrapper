     * data reads and writes that your application performs on your feature group. You do not need to
     * specify read and write throughput because Feature Store accommodates your workloads as they ramp
     * up and down. You can switch a feature group to on-demand only once in a 24 hour period. With
     * provisioned throughput mode, you specify the read and write capacity per second that you expect
     * your application to require, and you are billed based on those limits. Exceeding provisioned
     * throughput will result in your requests being throttled.
     *
     * Note: `PROVISIONED` throughput mode is supported only for feature groups that are
     * offline-only, or use the
     * [`Standard`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OnlineStoreConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-OnlineStoreConfig-StorageType)
     * tier online store.
