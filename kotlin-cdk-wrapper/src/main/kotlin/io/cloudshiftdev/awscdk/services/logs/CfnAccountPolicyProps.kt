   * Specify the policy, in JSON.
   *
   * *Data protection policy*
   *
   * A data protection policy must include two JSON blocks:
   *
   * * The first block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an `Operation` property with an
   * `Audit` action. The `DataIdentifer` array lists the types of sensitive data that you want to mask.
   * For more information about the available options, see [Types of data that you can
   * mask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data-types.html)
   * .
   *
   * The `Operation` property with an `Audit` action is required to find the sensitive data terms.
   * This `Audit` action must contain a `FindingsDestination` object. You can optionally use that
   * `FindingsDestination` object to list one or more destinations to send audit findings to. If you
   * specify destinations such as log groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already
   * exist.
   *
   * * The second block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an `Operation` property with
   * an `Deidentify` action. The `DataIdentifer` array must exactly match the `DataIdentifer` array in
   * the first block of the policy.
   *
   * The `Operation` property with the `Deidentify` action is what actually masks the data, and it
   * must contain the `"MaskConfig": {}` object. The `"MaskConfig": {}` object must be empty.
   *
   *
   * The contents of the two `DataIdentifer` arrays must match exactly.
   *
   *
   * In addition to the two JSON blocks, the `policyDocument` can also include `Name` ,
   * `Description` , and `Version` fields. The `Name` is different than the operation's `policyName`
   * parameter, and is used as a dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to
   * CloudWatch .
   *
   * The JSON specified in `policyDocument` can be up to 30,720 characters long.
   *
   * *Subscription filter policy*
   *
   * A subscription filter policy can include the following attributes in a JSON block:
   *
   * * *DestinationArn* The ARN of the destination to deliver log events to. Supported destinations
   * are:
   * * An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for
   * same-account delivery.
   * * An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account
   * delivery.
   * * A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
   * * A logical destination in a different account created with
   * [PutDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html)
   * , for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical
   * destinations.
   * * *RoleArn* The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested
   * log events to the destination stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with
   * a logical destination for cross-account delivery.
   * * *FilterPattern* A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.
   * * *Distribution* The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log
   * data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to `Random` for a more even
   * distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Kinesis Data Streams
   * data stream.
