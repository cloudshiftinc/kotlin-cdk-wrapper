/**
 * Creates or updates an Evidently *experiment* .
 *
 * Before you create an experiment, you must create the feature to use for the experiment.
 *
 * An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment
 * can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by
 * statistical methods, and provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.evidently.*;
 * CfnExperiment cfnExperiment = CfnExperiment.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnExperiment")
