/**
 * This is the latest version of *AWS WAF* , named AWS WAF V2, released in November, 2019.
 *
 * For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the
 * [AWS WAF developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .
 *
 * Use an `IPSet` to identify web requests that originate from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP
 * addresses. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from a ranges of IP addresses, you can
 * configure AWS WAF to block them using an IP set that lists those IP addresses.
 *
 * You use an IP set by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the rule statement
 * `IPSetReferenceStatement` , when you add a rule to a rule group or web ACL.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.wafv2.*;
 * CfnIPSet cfnIPSet = CfnIPSet.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnIPSet")
 * .addresses(List.of("addresses"))
 * .ipAddressVersion("ipAddressVersion")
 * .scope("scope")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .description("description")
 * .name("name")
 * .tags(List.of(CfnTag.builder()
 * .key("key")
 * .value("value")
 * .build()))
 * .build();
 * ```
 *

     * The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category
     * (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such
     * as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
     *
     *
     * To modify tags on existing resources, use the AWS WAF APIs or command line interface. With
     * AWS CloudFormation , you can only add tags to AWS WAF resources during resource creation.
     *
