  /**
   * Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already

   *
   * Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.
   *
   * The maximum number of entries per request is 10.
   *
   *
   * Each rule can have up to five (5) targets associated with it at one time.
   *
   *
   * For a list of services you can configure as targets for events, see [EventBridge
   * targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html) in the **Amazon
   * EventBridge User Guide** .
   *
   * Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console . The
   * built-in targets are:
   *
   * * `Amazon EBS CreateSnapshot API call`
   * * `Amazon EC2 RebootInstances API call`
   * * `Amazon EC2 StopInstances API call`
   * * `Amazon EC2 TerminateInstances API call`
   *
   * For some target types, `PutTargets` provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a
   * Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the
   * `KinesisParameters` argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can
   * use the `RunCommandParameters` field.
   *
   * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the
   * appropriate permissions:
   *
   * * For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies.
   * * For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway
   * APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the `RoleARN` argument in `PutTargets` .
   *
   * For more information, see [Authentication and Access
   * Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html)
   * in the **Amazon EventBridge User Guide** .
   *
   * If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using
   * `PutPermission` ), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target
   * of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that
   * account's event bus as the `Arn` value when you run `PutTargets` . If your account sends events to
   * another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account
   * is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more
   * information, see [Amazon EventBridge Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/) .
   *
   *
   * `Input` , `InputPath` , and `InputTransformer` are not available with `PutTarget` if the target
   * is an event bus of a different AWS account.
   *
   *
   * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted
   * permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you
   * must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions in the `Target` structure. For more information,
   * see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
   * Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html)
   * in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .
   *
   *
   * If you have an IAM role on a cross-account event bus target, a `PutTargets` call without a role
   * on the same target (same `Id` and `Arn` ) will not remove the role.
   *
   *
   * For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
   * [PutPermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutPermission.html)
   * .
   *
   * *Input* , *InputPath* , and *InputTransformer* are mutually exclusive and optional parameters
   * of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:
   *
   * * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is
   * passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS
   * task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).
   * * If *Input* is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with
   * this constant.
   * * If *InputPath* is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, `$.detail` ), then only the
   * part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part
   * of the event is passed).
   * * If *InputTransformer* is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from
   * the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
   *
   * When you specify `InputPath` or `InputTransformer` , you must use JSON dot notation, not
   * bracket notation.
   *
   * When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated
   * targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
   *
   * This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens,
   * `FailedEntryCount` is non-zero in the response and each entry in `FailedEntries` provides the ID
   * of the failed target and the error code.

     *
     * * For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies.
     * * For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway
     * APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the `RoleARN` argument in `PutTargets`
     * .
     *
     * For more information, see [Authentication and Access
     * Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html)
     * in the **Amazon EventBridge User Guide** .
     *
     * If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using
     * `PutPermission` ), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target
     * of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that
     * account's event bus as the `Arn` value when you run `PutTargets` . If your account sends events
     * to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another
     * account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more
     * information, see [Amazon EventBridge Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/)
     * .
     *
     *
     * `Input` , `InputPath` , and `InputTransformer` are not available with `PutTarget` if the
     * target is an event bus of a different AWS account.
     *
     *
     * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted
     * permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then
     * you must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions in the `Target` structure. For more
     * information, see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
     * Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html)
     * in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .
     *
     *
     * If you have an IAM role on a cross-account event bus target, a `PutTargets` call without a
     * role on the same target (same `Id` and `Arn` ) will not remove the role.
     *
     *
     * For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
     * [PutPermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutPermission.html)
     * .
     *
     * *Input* , *InputPath* , and *InputTransformer* are mutually exclusive and optional parameters
     * of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:
     *
     * * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is
     * passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS
     * task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).
     * * If *Input* is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden
     * with this constant.
     * * If *InputPath* is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, `$.detail` ), then only
     * the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the
     * detail part of the event is passed).
     * * If *InputTransformer* is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from
     * the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
     *
     * When you specify `InputPath` or `InputTransformer` , you must use JSON dot notation, not
     * bracket notation.
     *
     * When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated
     * targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take
     * effect.
     *
     * This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that
     * happens, `FailedEntryCount` is non-zero in the response and each entry in `FailedEntries`
     * provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.
