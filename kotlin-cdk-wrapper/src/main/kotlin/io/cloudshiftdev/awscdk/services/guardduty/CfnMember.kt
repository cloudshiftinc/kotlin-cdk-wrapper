/**
 * You can use the `AWS::GuardDuty::Member` resource to add an AWS account as a GuardDuty member
 * account to the current GuardDuty administrator account.
 *
 * If the value of the `Status` property is not provided or is set to `Created` , a member account
 * is created but not invited. If the value of the `Status` property is set to `Invited` , a member
 * account is created and invited. An `AWS::GuardDuty::Member` resource must be created with the
 * `Status` property set to `Invited` before the `AWS::GuardDuty::Master` resource can be created in a
 * GuardDuty member account.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.guardduty.*;
 * CfnMember cfnMember = CfnMember.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnMember")
 * .email("email")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .detectorId("detectorId")
