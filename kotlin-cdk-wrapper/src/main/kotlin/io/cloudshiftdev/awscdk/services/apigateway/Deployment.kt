/**
 * A Deployment of a REST API.
 *
 * An immutable representation of a RestApi resource that can be called by users
 * using Stages. A deployment must be associated with a Stage for it to be
 * callable over the Internet.
 *
 * Normally, you don't need to define deployments manually. The RestApi
 * construct manages a Deployment resource that represents the latest model. It
 * can be accessed through `restApi.latestDeployment` (unless `deploy: false` is
 * set when defining the `RestApi`).
 *
 * If you manually define this resource, you will need to know that since
 * deployments are immutable, as long as the resource's logical ID doesn't
 * change, the deployment will represent the snapshot in time in which the
 * resource was created. This means that if you modify the RestApi model (i.e.
 * add methods or resources), these changes will not be reflected unless a new
 * deployment resource is created.
 *
 * To achieve this behavior, the method `addToLogicalId(data)` can be used to
 * augment the logical ID generated for the deployment resource such that it
 * will include arbitrary data. This is done automatically for the
 * `restApi.latestDeployment` deployment.
 *
 * Furthermore, since a deployment does not reference any of the REST API
 * resources and methods, CloudFormation will likely provision it before these
 * resources are created, which means that it will represent a "half-baked"
 * model. Use the `node.addDependency(dep)` method to circumvent that. This is done
 * automatically for the `restApi.latestDeployment` deployment.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // production stage
 * LogGroup prodLogGroup = new LogGroup(this, "PrdLogs");
 * RestApi api = RestApi.Builder.create(this, "books")
 * .deployOptions(StageOptions.builder()
 * .accessLogDestination(new LogGroupLogDestination(prodLogGroup))
 * .accessLogFormat(AccessLogFormat.jsonWithStandardFields())
 * .build())
 * .build();
 * Deployment deployment = Deployment.Builder.create(this, "Deployment").api(api).build();
 * // development stage
 * LogGroup devLogGroup = new LogGroup(this, "DevLogs");
 * Stage.Builder.create(this, "dev")
 * .deployment(deployment)
 * .accessLogDestination(new LogGroupLogDestination(devLogGroup))
 * .accessLogFormat(AccessLogFormat.jsonWithStandardFields(JsonWithStandardFieldProps.builder()
 * .caller(false)
 * .httpMethod(true)
 * .ip(true)
 * .protocol(true)
 * .requestTime(true)
 * .resourcePath(true)
 * .responseLength(true)
 * .status(true)
 * .user(true)
 * .build()))
 * .build();
 * ```
