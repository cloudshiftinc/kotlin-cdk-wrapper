/**
 * Creates an AWS organization.
 *
 * The account whose user is calling the
 * [`CreateOrganization`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOrganization.html)
 * operation automatically becomes the [management
 * account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account)
 * of the new organization.
 *
 * This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is to become the new
 * organization's management account. The principal must also have the [relevant IAM
 * permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_create.html)
 * .
 *
 *
 * * If you delete an organization, you can't recover it. If you created any policies inside of the
 * organization, they're also deleted and you can't recover them.
 * * You can delete an organization only after you remove all member accounts from the organization.
 * If you created some of your member accounts using AWS Organizations , you might be blocked from
 * removing those accounts. You can remove a member account only if it has all the information that's
 * required to operate as a standalone AWS account. For more information about how to provide that
 * information and then remove the account, see [Leave an organization from your member
 * account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_leave-as-member.html)
 * in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .
 * * If you closed a member account before you remove it from the organization, it enters a
 * 'suspended' state for a period of time and you can't remove the account from the organization until
 * it is finally closed. This can take up to 90 days and can prevent you from deleting the organization
 * until all member accounts are completely closed.
 *
 * For more information, see [Deleting an
 * organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_delete.html)
 * in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.organizations.*;
 * CfnOrganization cfnOrganization = CfnOrganization.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnOrganization")
 * .featureSet("featureSet")
 * .build();
 * ```
