/**
 * Represents a group of Job Definitions.
 *
 * All Job Definitions that
 * declare a share identifier will be considered members of the Share
 * defined by that share identifier.
 *
 * The Scheduler divides the maximum available vCPUs of the ComputeEnvironment
 * among Jobs in the Queue based on their shareIdentifier and the weightFactor
 * associated with that shareIdentifier.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * FairshareSchedulingPolicy fairsharePolicy = new FairshareSchedulingPolicy(this,
 * "myFairsharePolicy");
 * fairsharePolicy.addShare(Share.builder()
 * .shareIdentifier("A")
 * .weightFactor(1)
 * .build());
 * fairsharePolicy.addShare(Share.builder()
 * .shareIdentifier("B")
 * .weightFactor(1)
 * .build());
 * JobQueue.Builder.create(this, "JobQueue")
 * .schedulingPolicy(fairsharePolicy)
 * .build();
 * ```
