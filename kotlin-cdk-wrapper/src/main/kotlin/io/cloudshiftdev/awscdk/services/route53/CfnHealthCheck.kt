/**
 * The `AWS::Route53::HealthCheck` resource is a Route 53 resource type that contains settings for a
 * Route 53 health check.
 *
 * For information about associating health checks with records, see
 * [HealthCheckId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ResourceRecordSet.html#Route53-Type-ResourceRecordSet-HealthCheckId)
 * in
 * [ChangeResourceRecordSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html)
 * .
 *
 *
 * You can't create a health check with simple routing.
 *
 *
 * *ELB Load Balancers*
 *
 * If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not
 * create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a
 * load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to
 * a Route 53 health check.
 *
 * *Private Hosted Zones*
 *
 * You can associate health checks with failover records in a private hosted zone. Note the
 * following:
 *
 * * Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC
 * by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
 * * You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the
 * instance relies on, such as a database server.
 * * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a
 * health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch
 * metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add an alarm to the
 * metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information
 * about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon
 * CloudWatch User
 * Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) .
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.route53.*;
 * CfnHealthCheck cfnHealthCheck = CfnHealthCheck.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnHealthCheck")

     * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for `IPAddress` .
     *
     * *If you specify a value for* `IPAddress` :
     *
     * Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
     * the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP
     * health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want
     * Route 53 to perform health checks.
     *
     * When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host` header:
     *
     * * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type` , Route
     * 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
     * * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
     * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
     * * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type` , Route 53
     * passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
     *
     * If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , Route 53 substitutes the value
     * of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.
     *
     * *If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`* :
     *
     * Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at
     * the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns,
     * Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
     *
     *
     * If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks
     * to the endpoint. If there's no record with a type of A for the name that you specify for
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
     *
     *
     * If you want to check the health of multiple records that have the same name and type, such as
     * multiple weighted records, and if you choose to specify the endpoint only by
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
     * endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for
     * www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the
     * server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (www.example.com).
     *
     *
     * In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the records and you then associate the health
     * check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.
     *
     *
     * In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP` , `HTTPS` , `HTTP_STR_MATCH`
     * , or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` , Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host`
     * header, as it does when you specify a value for `IPAddress` . If the value of `Type` is `TCP` ,
     * Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

     * string that you specify in `SearchString` .
     * * *TCP* : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
     * * *CLOUDWATCH_METRIC* : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
     * of the alarm is `OK` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is `ALARM` , the
     * health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine

     * * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics aren't
     * supported.
     *
     *
     * * *CALCULATED* : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53

       * *If you specify a value for* `IPAddress` :
       *
       * Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
       * passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks
       * except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
       * which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
       *
       * When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host`
       * header:
       *
       * * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
       * * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       * * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type` , Route 53
       * passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , Route 53 substitutes the
       * value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.
       *
       * *If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`* :
       *
       * Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
       * at the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
       * returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
       *
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
       * checks to the endpoint. If there's no record with a type of A for the name that you specify
       * for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
       *
       *
       * If you want to check the health of multiple records that have the same name and type, such
       * as multiple weighted records, and if you choose to specify the endpoint only by
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
       * endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for
       * www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the
       * server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (www.example.com).
       *
       *
       * In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the records and you then associate the health
       * check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.
       *
       *
       * In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP` , `HTTPS` ,
       * `HTTP_STR_MATCH` , or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` , Route 53 passes the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for
       * `IPAddress` . If the value of `Type` is `TCP` , Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

       * *If you specify a value for* `IPAddress` :
       *
       * Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
       * passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks
       * except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
       * which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
       *
       * When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host`
       * header:
       *
       * * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
       * * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       * * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type` , Route 53
       * passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , Route 53 substitutes the
       * value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.
       *
       * *If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`* :
       *
       * Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
       * at the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
       * returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
       *
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
       * checks to the endpoint. If there's no record with a type of A for the name that you specify
       * for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
       *
       *
       * If you want to check the health of multiple records that have the same name and type, such
       * as multiple weighted records, and if you choose to specify the endpoint only by
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
       * endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for
       * www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the
       * server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (www.example.com).
       *
       *
       * In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the records and you then associate the health
       * check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.
       *
       *
       * In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP` , `HTTPS` ,
       * `HTTP_STR_MATCH` , or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` , Route 53 passes the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for
       * `IPAddress` . If the value of `Type` is `TCP` , Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

       * string that you specify in `SearchString` .
       * * *TCP* : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
       * * *CLOUDWATCH_METRIC* : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
       * state of the alarm is `OK` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is `ALARM` ,

       *
       *
       * Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:
       *
       * * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
       * information, see [High-Resolution

       * supported.
       *
       *
       * * *CALCULATED* : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
       * adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
       * compares that number with the value of `HealthThreshold` .
       * * *RECOVERY_CONTROL* : The health check is assocated with a Route53 Application Recovery
       * Controller routing control. If the routing control state is `ON` , the health check is

       * message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be `SSL alert

       * enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
       * and confirm that your certificate is valid.
       *
       * The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the `Common Name` field

       * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for `IPAddress` .
       *
       * *If you specify a value for* `IPAddress` :
       *
       * Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
       * passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks
       * except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
       * which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
       *
       * When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host`
       * header:
       *
       * * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
       * * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type` ,
       * Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       * * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type` , Route 53
       * passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , Route 53 substitutes the
       * value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.
       *
       * *If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`* :
       *
       * Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
       * at the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
       * returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
       *
       *
       * If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
       * checks to the endpoint. If there's no record with a type of A for the name that you specify
       * for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
       *
       *
       * If you want to check the health of multiple records that have the same name and type, such
       * as multiple weighted records, and if you choose to specify the endpoint only by
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
       * endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for
       * www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the
       * server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (www.example.com).
       *
       *
       * In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the records and you then associate the health
       * check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.
       *
       *
       * In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP` , `HTTPS` ,
       * `HTTP_STR_MATCH` , or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` , Route 53 passes the value of
       * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for
       * `IPAddress` . If the value of `Type` is `TCP` , Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.
