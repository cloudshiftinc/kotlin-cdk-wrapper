/**
 * The `AWS::KMS::Key` resource specifies an [KMS
 * key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys) in AWS Key
 * Management Service . You can use this resource to create symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric
 * KMS keys for encryption or signing, and symmetric HMAC KMS keys. You can use `AWS::KMS::Key` to
 * create [multi-Region primary
 * keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-primary-key)
 * of all supported types. To replicate a multi-Region key, use the `AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey` resource.
 *
 *
 * If you change the value of the `KeySpec` , `KeyUsage` , `Origin` , or `MultiRegion` properties of
 * an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [`UpdateReplacePolicy`
 * attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html)
 * . This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing any of its immutable property
 * values. &gt; AWS KMS replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *AWS KMS key* and *KMS key*
 * . The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some variations of
 * this term.
 *
 *
 * You can use symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they
 * are more commonly used to generate data keys and data key pairs. You can also use a symmetric
 * encryption KMS key to encrypt data stored in AWS services that are [integrated with AWS
 * KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration) . For more information, see
 * [Symmetric encryption KMS
 * keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks) in the
 * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 * You can use asymmetric KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt data or sign messages and verify
 * signatures. To create an asymmetric key, you must specify an asymmetric `KeySpec` value and a
 * `KeyUsage` value. For details, see [Asymmetric keys in AWS
 * KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the *AWS
 * Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 * You can use HMAC KMS keys (which are also symmetric keys) to generate and verify hash-based
 * message authentication codes. To create an HMAC key, you must specify an HMAC `KeySpec` value and a
 * `KeyUsage` value of `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC` . For details, see [HMAC keys in AWS
 * KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html) in the *AWS Key Management
 * Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 * You can also create symmetric encryption, asymmetric, and HMAC multi-Region primary keys. To
 * create a multi-Region primary key, set the `MultiRegion` property to `true` . For information about
 * multi-Region keys, see [Multi-Region keys in AWS
 * KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the
 * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 * You cannot use the `AWS::KMS::Key` resource to specify a KMS key with [imported key
 * material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) or a KMS key in
 * a [custom key
 * store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) .
 *
 * *Regions*
 *
 * AWS KMS CloudFormation resources are available in all Regions in which AWS KMS and AWS
 * CloudFormation are supported. You can use the `AWS::KMS::Key` resource to create and manage all KMS
 * key types that are supported in a Region.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * CfnInclude cfnTemplate;
 * CfnKey cfnKey = (CfnKey)cfnTemplate.getResource("Key");
 * IKey key = Key.fromCfnKey(cfnKey);
 * ```
 *
