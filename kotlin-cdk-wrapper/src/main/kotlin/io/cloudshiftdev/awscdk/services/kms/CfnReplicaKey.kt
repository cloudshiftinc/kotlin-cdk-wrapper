/**
 * The `AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey` resource specifies a multi-Region replica key that is based on a
 * multi-Region primary key.
 *
 * *Multi-Region keys* are an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys
 * in different AWS Regions . Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other
 * metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS
 * Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information, see
 * [Multi-Region
 * keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the
 * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 * A multi-Region *primary key* is a fully functional symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, or
 * asymmetric KMS key that is also the model for replica keys in other AWS Regions . To create a
 * multi-Region primary key, add an
 * [AWS::KMS::Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-kms-key.html)
 * resource to your CloudFormation stack. Set its `MultiRegion` property to true.
 *
 * A multi-Region *replica key* is a fully functional KMS key that has the same key ID and key
 * material as a multi-Region primary key, but is located in a different AWS Region of the same AWS
 * partition. There can be multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different AWS
 * Region .
 *
 * When you create a replica key in AWS CloudFormation , the replica key is created in the AWS
 * Region represented by the endpoint you use for the request. If you try to replicate a multi-Region
 * key into a Region in which the key type is not supported, the request will fail.
 *
 * A primary key and its replicas have the same key ID and key material. They also have the same key
 * spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation status. These properties are known
 * as *shared properties* . If they change, AWS KMS synchronizes the change to all related multi-Region
 * keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its key policy, tags, aliases, and
 * key state. AWS KMS does not synchronize these properties.
 *
 * *Regions*
 *
 * AWS KMS CloudFormation resources are available in all AWS Regions in which AWS KMS and AWS
 * CloudFormation are supported. You can use the `AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey` resource to create replica keys
 * in all Regions that support multi-Region KMS keys. For details, see [Multi-Region keys in AWS
 * KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the
 * ** .

 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
