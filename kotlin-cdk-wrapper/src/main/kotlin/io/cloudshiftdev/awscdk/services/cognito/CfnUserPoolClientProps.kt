     * for `RefreshTokenValidity` as `seconds` , `minutes` , `hours` , or `days` , set a
     * `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.
     *
     * For example, when you set `RefreshTokenValidity` as `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` as `days` ,
     * your user can refresh their session
     * and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days.

     * The default time unit for `RefreshTokenValidity` in an API request is days. You can't set
     * `RefreshTokenValidity` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default
     * value of 30 days. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.
     *
     * If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your refresh
     * tokens are valid for 30 days.
