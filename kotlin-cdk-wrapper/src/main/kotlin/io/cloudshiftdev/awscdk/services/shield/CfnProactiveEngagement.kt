/**
 * Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) to use email and phone to notify contacts about
 * escalations to the SRT and to initiate proactive customer support.
 *
 * To enable proactive engagement, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support
 * plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support
 * plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/) .
 *
 * *Configure `AWS::Shield::ProactiveEngagement` for one account*
 *
 * To configure this resource through AWS CloudFormation , you must be subscribed to AWS Shield
 * Advanced . You can subscribe through the [Shield Advanced
 * console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/) and through the APIs. For more information,
 * see [Subscribe to AWS Shield
 * Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-ddos-prem.html) .
 *
 * See example templates for Shield Advanced in AWS CloudFormation at
 * [aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples)
 * .
 *
 * *Configure Shield Advanced using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Firewall Manager*
 *
 * You might be able to use Firewall Manager with AWS CloudFormation to configure Shield Advanced
 * across multiple accounts and protected resources. To do this, your accounts must be part of an
 * organization in AWS Organizations . You can use Firewall Manager to configure Shield Advanced
 * protections for any resource types except for Amazon RouteÂ 53 or AWS Global Accelerator .
 *
 * For an example of this, see the one-click configuration guidance published by the AWS technical
 * community at [One-click deployment of Shield
 * Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://youtu.be/LCA3FwMk_QE) .
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.shield.*;
 * CfnProactiveEngagement cfnProactiveEngagement = CfnProactiveEngagement.Builder.create(this,
 * "MyCfnProactiveEngagement")
 * .emergencyContactList(List.of(EmergencyContactProperty.builder()
 * .emailAddress("emailAddress")
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .contactNotes("contactNotes")
 * .phoneNumber("phoneNumber")
 * .build()))
 * .proactiveEngagementStatus("proactiveEngagementStatus")
 * .build();
 * ```
