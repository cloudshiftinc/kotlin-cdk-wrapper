/**
 * The `AWS::ECS::Service` resource creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service
 * that runs and maintains the requested number of tasks and associated load balancers.
 *
 *
 * The stack update fails if you change any properties that require replacement and at least one
 * Amazon ECS Service Connect `ServiceConnectService` is configured. This is because AWS CloudFormation
 * creates the replacement service first, but each `ServiceConnectService` must have a name that is
 * unique in the namespace. &gt; Starting April 15, 2023, AWS ; will not onboard new customers to
 * Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options
 * that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to
 * launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS , or Amazon EC2 .
 * However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are
 * considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.

     * instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The

       * minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers
       * within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can
       * wait for is determined by the container health check settings.
       *
       * For services that *do* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:
       *
       * * If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler
       * will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before
       * counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.
       * * If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler
       * will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group
       * health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy
       * percent total.
       *
       * The default value for a replica service for `minimumHealthyPercent` is 100%. The default
       * `minimumHealthyPercent` value for a service using the `DAEMON` service schedule is 0% for the
       * AWS CLI , the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.
       *
       * The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the `desiredCount` multiplied by
       * the `minimumHealthyPercent` /100, rounded up to the nearest integer value.
       *
       * If a service is using either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY` ) or `EXTERNAL` deployment
       * types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *minimum healthy percent* value
       * is set to the default value and is used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks
       * in the service that remain in the `RUNNING` state while the container instances are in the
       * `DRAINING` state. If a service is using either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY` ) or `EXTERNAL`
       * deployment types and is running tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy
       * percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.

   * option to [`docker
   * run`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) .
   *
   * By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the
   * container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver
   * configuration in the container definition. For more information about the options for different
   * supported log drivers, see [Configure logging
   * drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in
   * the Docker documentation.
   *
   * Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.
   *
   * * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon.
   * Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.
   *
   * For tasks on AWS Fargate , the supported log drivers are `awslogs` , `splunk` , and
   * `awsfirelens` .
   *
   * For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are `awslogs` , `fluentd` ,
   * `gelf` , `json-file` , `journald` , `logentries` , `syslog` , `splunk` , and `awsfirelens` .
   *
   * * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container
   * instance.
   * * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container agent must
   * register the available logging drivers with the `ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS` environment
   * variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For
   * more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent
   * configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)
   * in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
   * * For tasks that are on AWS Fargate , because you don't have access to the underlying
   * infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software needed must be installed outside
   * of the task. For example, the Fluentd output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send
   * Gelf logs to.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```
   * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
   * // The values are placeholders you should change.
