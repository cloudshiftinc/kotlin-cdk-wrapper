     * * Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion

     * The `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica.
     * If you remove the `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property from your template and then update your
     * stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the read replica to a standalone DB instance.
     *
     * If you specify the `UseLatestRestorableTime` or `RestoreTime` properties in conjunction with
     * the `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property, RDS restores the DB instance to the requested point
     * in time, thereby creating a new DB instance.
     *
     *
     * * If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you
     * specify the `VPCSecurityGroups` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica
     * inherits the value of the `VPCSecurityGroups` property from the source DB when you create the
     * replica. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation reverts the replica's
     * `VPCSecurityGroups` property to the default value because it's not defined in the stack's
     * template. This change might cause unexpected issues.
     * * Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion
     * policy that's associated with a read replica.
     * * If you specify `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` , don't specify the `DBSnapshotIdentifier`
     * property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot.
     * * Don't set the `BackupRetentionPeriod` , `DBName` , `MasterUsername` , `MasterUserPassword`
     * , and `PreferredBackupWindow` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source
     * DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas.
     * * If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the
     * source region in `SourceRegion` , and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in
     * `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` . For more information, see [Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon

     * A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance.

     * resources created in the template.
     *
     * If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.
     *
     * If you set `VPCSecurityGroups` , you must not set
     * [`DBSecurityGroups`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups)
     * , and vice versa.
     *
     *
     * You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security
     * group, but keep the following in mind:
     *
     * * You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group
     * membership.
     * * When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back
     * because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation
     * resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group.
     * * To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must
     * recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that
     * are listed in the
     * [`DBSecurityGroups`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups)
     * property.
     *
     *
     * To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that
     * is the only change in your stack template.
     *
     * *Amazon Aurora*
