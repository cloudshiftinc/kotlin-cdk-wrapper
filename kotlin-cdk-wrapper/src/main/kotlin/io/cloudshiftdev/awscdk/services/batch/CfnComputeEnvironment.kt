/**
 * The `AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment` resource defines your AWS Batch compute environment.
 *
 * You can define `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED` compute environments. `MANAGED` compute environments can
 * use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. `UNMANAGED` compute environments can only use EC2
 * resources. For more information, see [Compute
 * Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the
 * ** .
 *
 * In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the
 * compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that
 * you define or the [launch
 * template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) that you
 * specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose either to use EC2 On-Demand
 * Instances and EC2 Spot Instances, or to use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed
 * compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when
 * the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.
 *
 *
 * Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.
 *
 *
 * In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot
 * of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMI.
 * However, you need to verify that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification.
 * For more information, see [container instance
 * AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html) in
 * the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* . After you have created your unmanaged
 * compute environment, you can use the
 * [DescribeComputeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeComputeEnvironments.html)
 * operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it. Then, manually launch your
 * container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see [Launching an Amazon ECS
 * container
 * instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html)
 * in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
 *
 *
 * To create a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must have permissions to call
 * `eks:DescribeCluster` . &gt; AWS Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's
 * created except under specific conditions. For example, it doesn't automatically update the AMIs when
 * a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for the
 * management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and any additional
 * application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. There are two ways to
 * use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs. The original method is to complete these steps:
 *
 * * Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.
 * * Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.
 * * Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.
 * * Delete the earlier compute environment.
 *
 * In April 2022, AWS Batch added enhanced support for updating compute environments. For example,
 * the `UpdateComputeEnvironent` API lets you use the `ReplaceComputeEnvironment` property to
 * dynamically update compute environment parameters such as the launch template or instance type
 * without replacement. For more information, see [Updating compute
 * environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
 * in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
 *
 * To use the enhanced updating of compute environments to update AMIs, follow these rules:
 *
 * * Either do not set the
 * [ServiceRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-batch-computeenvironment.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-servicerole)
 * property or set it to the *AWSServiceRoleForBatch* service-linked role.
 * * Set the
 * [AllocationStrategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-allocationstrategy)
 * property to `BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` or `SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` .
 * * Set the
 * [ReplaceComputeEnvironment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-batch-computeenvironment.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-replacecomputeenvironment)
 * property to `false` .
 *
 *
 * Set the `ReplaceComputeEnvironment` property to `true` if the compute environment uses the
 * `BEST_FIT` allocation strategy. &gt; If the `ReplaceComputeEnvironment` property is set to `false` ,
 * you might receive an error message when you update the CFN template for a compute environment. This
 * issue occurs if the updated `desiredvcpus` value is less than the current `desiredvcpus` value. As a
 * workaround, delete the `desiredvcpus` value from the updated template or use the `minvcpus` property
 * to manage the number of vCPUs. For information, see [Error message when you update the
 * `DesiredvCpus`
 * setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#error-desired-vcpus-update)
 * .
 *
 *
 * * Set the
 * [UpdateToLatestImageVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-updatetolatestimageversion)
 * property to `true` . This property is used when you update a compute environment. The
 * [UpdateToLatestImageVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-updatetolatestimageversion)
 * property is ignored when you create a compute environment.
 * * Either do not specify an image ID in
 * [ImageId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-imageid)
 * or
 * [ImageIdOverride](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-ec2configurationobject.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-ec2configurationobject-imageidoverride)
 * properties, or in the launch template identified by the [Launch
 * Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-launchtemplate)
 * property. In that case AWS Batch will select the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI supported by AWS
 * Batch at the time the infrastructure update is initiated. Alternatively you can specify the AMI ID
 * in the `ImageId` or `ImageIdOverride` properties, or the launch template identified by the
 * `LaunchTemplate` properties. Changing any of these properties will trigger an infrastructure update.
 *
 * If these rules are followed, any update that triggers an infrastructure update will cause the AMI
 * ID to be re-selected. If the
 * [Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification-version)
 * property of the
 * [LaunchTemplateSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification.html)
 * is set to `$Latest` or `$Default` , the latest or default version of the launch template will be
 * evaluated up at the time of the infrastructure update, even if the `LaunchTemplateSpecification` was
 * not updated.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.batch.*;

     * Spot Instance compute resources.
     * * **SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy

       * large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance
       * types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for
       * Spot Instance compute resources.
       * * **SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy
