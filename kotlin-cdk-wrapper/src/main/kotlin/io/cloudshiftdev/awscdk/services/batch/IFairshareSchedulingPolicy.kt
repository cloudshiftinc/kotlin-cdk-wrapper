/**
 * Represents a Fairshare Scheduling Policy. Instructs the scheduler to allocate ComputeEnvironment
 * vCPUs based on Job shareIdentifiers.
 *
 * The Faireshare Scheduling Policy ensures that each share gets a certain amount of vCPUs.
 * It does this by deciding how many Jobs of each share to schedule *relative to how many jobs of
 * each share are currently being executed by the ComputeEnvironment*. The weight factors associated
 * with
 * each share determine the ratio of vCPUs allocated; see the readme for a more in-depth discussion
 * of
 * fairshare policies.
