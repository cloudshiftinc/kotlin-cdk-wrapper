/**
 * A *channel* is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to.
 *
 * You can use the email channel to send email to users. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send
 * email, you must enable the email channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
 *
 * The EmailChannel resource represents the status, identity, and other settings of the email
 * channel for an application
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.pinpoint.*;
 * CfnEmailChannel cfnEmailChannel = CfnEmailChannel.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnEmailChannel")

 * .fromAddress("fromAddress")
