     * needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR

     * logically group the functions in your expression.
     *
     * You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be
     * evaluated.
     *
     * Functions can include the following:
     *
     * * ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.
     * * OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.

     * INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

     * alarm actions.
