/**
 * A *channel* is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to.
 *
 * You can use the Baidu channel to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud Push notification service.
 * Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud Push service, you have
 * to enable the Baidu channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
 *
 * The BaiduChannel resource represents the status and authentication settings of the Baidu channel
 * for an application.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.pinpoint.*;
 * CfnBaiduChannel cfnBaiduChannel = CfnBaiduChannel.Builder.create(this, "MyCfnBaiduChannel")
 * .apiKey("apiKey")

 * .secretKey("secretKey")
 * // the properties below are optional
