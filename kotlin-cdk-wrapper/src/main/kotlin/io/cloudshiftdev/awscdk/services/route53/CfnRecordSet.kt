     * If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query
     * only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the `HealthCheckId` element and
     * specify the ID of the applicable health check.
     *
     * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:
     *
     * * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)
     * * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)
     *
     *
     * Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
     * set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the `Value` element. When you add
     * a `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint
     * that you specified in the health check.
     *
     *
     * For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :
     *
     * * [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
     * Healthy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html)
     * * [Route 53 Health Checks and DNS
     * Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)
     * * [Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted
     * Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html)
     *
     * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
     *
     * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
     * or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice
     * in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
     * following configurations:
     *
     * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record
     * among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
     * to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
     * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     *
     * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record
     * set in the same hosted zone.
     * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
     * healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
     * alias resource record set.
     *
     *
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
     * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate
     * health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record
     * sets.
     *
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
     * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have
     * resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North
     * America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all
     * locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for
     * healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for
     * which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * * The United States
     * * North America
     * * The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create
     * a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP`
     * server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
     * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     *
     * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     *
     * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of
     * a resource record set.
     * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.
     *

     * only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the `HealthCheckId` element and
     * specify the ID of the applicable health check.
     *
     * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:
     *
     * * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)
     * * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)
     *
     *
     * Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
     * set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the `Value` element. When you add
     * a `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint
     * that you specified in the health check.
     *
     *
     * For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :
     *
     * * [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
     * Healthy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html)
     * * [Route 53 Health Checks and DNS
     * Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)
     * * [Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted
     * Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html)
     *
     * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
     *
     * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
     * or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice
     * in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
     * following configurations:
     *
     * * *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record
     * among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
     * to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53
     * considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     *
     * * *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     * * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
     * resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record
     * set in the same hosted zone.
     * * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
     * healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
     * alias resource record set.
     *
     *
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
     * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate
     * health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record
     * sets.
     *
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
     * resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have
     * resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North
     * America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all
     * locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for
     * healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for
     * which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * * The United States
     * * North America
     * * The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create
     * a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP`
     * server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of
     * `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
     * `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     *
     * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     *
     * * Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of
     * a resource record set.
     * * Associate that health check with the resource record set.
     *
     *
     * [Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-route53-recordset.html#cfn-route53-recordset-healthcheckid)
     * @param healthCheckId If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
     * response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the
     * `HealthCheckId` element and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

     * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
     *
     * * **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

     * registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2
     * instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
     * resources.
     * * *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
     * Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load
     * balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
     * * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
     * that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
     * only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries
     * to other resources.
     * * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
     *
     *
     * When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
     * checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create
     * Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.

       *
       * For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
       * region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
       * alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example,
       * if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
       * acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
       * routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
       *

       *
       * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of

       * You can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront

       *
       * For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the

       * matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name,
       * and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.
       *
       *
       * * **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk
       * environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias
       * record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment.
       * *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
       *
       *
       * For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
       * region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
       * alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example,
       * if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
       * acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
       * routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
       *
       *
       * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME`
       * attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
       * attribute:
       *

       *
       * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of

       *
       * You can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront

       *
       *
       * For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
       * primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that
       * matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name,
       * and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.
       *
       *
       * * **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk
       * environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias
       * record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment.
       * *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
       *
       *
       * For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
       * region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
       * alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example,
       * if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
       * acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
       * routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
       *
       *
       * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME`
       * attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
       * attribute:
       *

       *
       * Note the following:
       *
       * * **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the
       * alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
       * * **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an
       * Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer,
       * Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
       * registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer
       * if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true`
       * and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route
       * 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
       *
       * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
       * requirements.
       *
       * * **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
       * * *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` ,
       * Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
       * registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no
       * EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
       * other resources.
       * * *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
       * Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the
       * load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
       * balancer:
       * * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
       * that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
       * only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries
       * to other resources.
       * * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
       *
       *
       * When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
       * checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create
       * Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
       *
       *
       * * **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to
       * `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
       * * **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in
       * `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is
       * not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the
       * records in the alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit Health
       * Checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting)
