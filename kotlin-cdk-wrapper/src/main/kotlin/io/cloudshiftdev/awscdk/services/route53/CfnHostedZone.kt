/**
 * Creates a new public or private hosted zone.
 *
 * You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the
 * internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com).
 * You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and
 * its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).
 *
 *
 * You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must
 * create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.
 *
 *
 * For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route 53
 * Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .
 *
 * Note the following:
 *
 * * You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com.
 * * If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name
 * servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information,
 * see [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon
 * Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) in the
 * *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
 *
 * When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of the hosted zone is `PENDING`
 * . For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all
 * Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to
 * `INSYNC` .
 *
 * The `CreateHostedZone` request requires the caller to have an `ec2:DescribeVpcs` permission.
 *
 *
 * When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition where the
 * hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of AWS Regions . Each AWS account is scoped to one
 * partition.
 *
 * The following are the supported partitions:
 *
 * * `aws` - AWS Regions
 * * `aws-cn` - China Regions
 * * `aws-us-gov` - AWS GovCloud (US) Region
 *
 * For more information, see [Access
 * Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *AWS
 * General Reference* .
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import io.cloudshiftdev.awscdk.services.route53.*;

     * If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs
     * these operations automatically.

     *

     * * When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log
     * groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the
     * number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query
     * logging.
     *

     * * For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query
     * logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy
     * problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM
     * User Guide* .
     *
     *
     * You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the
     * CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI .
     *
     *
     * * **Log Streams and Edge Locations** - When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for
     * DNS query logging, it does the following:
     * * Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to
     * DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route
     * 53 responds to for that edge location.
     * * Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     *
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     *
     * `*hosted zone ID* / *edge location code*`
     *
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for
     * example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport
     * Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might
     * change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the
     * [Route 53 Product Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.
     *
     * * **Queries That Are Logged** - Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers
     * forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the
     * IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached
     * response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding
     * resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource
     * record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain
     * information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to
     * DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or
     * Web
     * Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html)
     * in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * * **Log File Format** - For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each
     * value, see [Logging DNS
     * Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html) in the
     * *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * * **Pricing** - For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch
     * Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) .
     * * **How to Stop Logging** - If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch
     * Logs, delete the query logging configuration. For more information, see
     * [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.html)

     * Creates a configuration for DNS query logging.
     *
     * After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to
     * an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
     *
     * DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified
     * public hosted zone, such as the following:
     *
     * * Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query
     * * Domain or subdomain that was requested
     * * DNS record type, such as A or AAAA
     * * DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`
     * * **Log Group and Resource Policy** - Before you create a query logging configuration,
     * perform the following operations.
     *
     *
     * If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs
     * these operations automatically.
     *
     *
     * * Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you
     * create a query logging configuration. Note the following:
     * * You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
     * * You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want
     * to configure query logging for.
     * * When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log
     * groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the
     * number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query
     * logging.
     *
     * * Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs
     * to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. You must create the CloudWatch Logs
     * resource policy in the us-east-1 region. For the value of `Resource` , specify the ARN for the
     * log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the
     * CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted
     * zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/ *`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission
     * for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the
     * permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the
     * following values:
     *
     * * For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging
     * configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * * For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query
     * logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy
     * problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM
     * User Guide* .
     *
     *
     * You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the
     * CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI .
     *
     *
     * * **Log Streams and Edge Locations** - When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for
     * DNS query logging, it does the following:
     * * Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to
     * DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route
     * 53 responds to for that edge location.
     * * Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     *
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     *
     * `*hosted zone ID* / *edge location code*`
     *
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for
     * example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport
     * Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might
     * change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the
     * [Route 53 Product Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.
     *
     * * **Queries That Are Logged** - Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers

     * log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the
     * CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted
     * zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/ *`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission
     * for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the
     * permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the
     * following values:
     *
     * * For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging
     * configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * * For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query
     * logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy
     * problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM
     * User Guide* .
     *
     *
     * You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the
     * CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI .
     *
     *
     * * **Log Streams and Edge Locations** - When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for
     * DNS query logging, it does the following:
     * * Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to
     * DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route
     * 53 responds to for that edge location.
     * * Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     *
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     *
     * `*hosted zone ID* / *edge location code*`
     *
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for
     * example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport
     * Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might
     * change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the
     * [Route 53 Product Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.
     *
     * * **Queries That Are Logged** - Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers
     * forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the
     * IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached
     * response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding
     * resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource
     * record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain
     * information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to
     * DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or
     * Web
     * Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html)
     * in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * * **Log File Format** - For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each
     * value, see [Logging DNS
     * Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html) in the
     * *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * * **Pricing** - For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch
     * Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) .
     * * **How to Stop Logging** - If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch
     * Logs, delete the query logging configuration. For more information, see
     * [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.html)

    /**
     * Creates a configuration for DNS query logging.
     *
     * After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to
     * an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
     *
     * DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified
     * public hosted zone, such as the following:
     *
     * * Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query
     * * Domain or subdomain that was requested
     * * DNS record type, such as A or AAAA
     * * DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`
     * * **Log Group and Resource Policy** - Before you create a query logging configuration,
     * perform the following operations.
     *
     *
     * If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs
     * these operations automatically.
     *
     *
     * * Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you
     * create a query logging configuration. Note the following:
     * * You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
     * * You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want
     * to configure query logging for.
     * * When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log
     * groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the
     * number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent
     * prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query
     * logging.
     *
     * * Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs
     * to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. You must create the CloudWatch Logs
     * resource policy in the us-east-1 region. For the value of `Resource` , specify the ARN for the
     * log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the
     * CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted
     * zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/ *`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission
     * for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the
     * permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the

     *
     * * For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging
     * configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * * For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query
     * logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy
     * problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM
     * User Guide* .
