     * viewerâ€™s video-quality choice is limited to the original input. Resolution can be up to 1080p
     * and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions between 480p and
     * 1080p.
     * * `ADVANCED_SD` : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are generated from the original
     * input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network
     * conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps; output is
     * capped at SD quality (480p). You can select an optional transcode preset (see below). Audio for
     * all renditions is transcoded, and an audio-only rendition is available.
     * * `ADVANCED_HD` : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are generated from the original
     * input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network
     * conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps; output is
     * capped at HD quality (720p). You can select an optional transcode preset (see below). Audio for
     * all renditions is transcoded, and an audio-only rendition is available.
     *
     * Optional *transcode presets* (available for the `ADVANCED` types) allow you to trade off
     * available download bandwidth and video quality, to optimize the viewing experience. There are
     * two presets:
     *
     * * *Constrained bandwidth delivery* uses a lower bitrate for each quality level. Use it if you
     * have low download bandwidth and/or simple video content (e.g., talking heads)
     * * *Higher bandwidth delivery* uses a higher bitrate for each quality level. Use it if you
     * have high download bandwidth and/or complex video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene
     * changes).
     *
     * *Default* : `STANDARD`
     *
     * Default: - "STANDARD"
